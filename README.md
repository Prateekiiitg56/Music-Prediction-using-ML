## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the popularity of songs using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing various audio and metadata features, the model attempts to determine whether a song is likely to be popular. The project is implemented primarily using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to experiment with data, models, and visualizations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.
